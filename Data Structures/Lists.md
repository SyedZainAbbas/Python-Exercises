**Data Structures** are containers that organize data. There are four basic data structures in Python;
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Tuples
* Sets

**Lists** can be thought of the most general version of a sequence in Python. Unlike strings, they are mutable, meaning the elements inside a list can be changed! Lists are ordered sequence meaning they can be called with the indexes. Lists are used when order of a sequence is important, for instance you want to keep track of a queue so that everyone gets served in an orderly manner.

**Dictianries** are mutable, ordered (from Python 3.7 onwards). Although they are ordered they cannot be indexed. Dictionaries store the data in the form of key-value pairs. An item can be called through a key, and the repition of keys is not allowed.

**Tuples** are immutable and ordered. They are used when we do not want to alter the data, once it is created.

**Sets** are unique, unordered and unchangeable type of data structure however, we can add or remove items from a set. They are used when the existence of an item is more important than the number of times an item appears in a collection.
