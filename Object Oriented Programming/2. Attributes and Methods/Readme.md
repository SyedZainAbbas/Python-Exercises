 ## Attributes 
They hold data in a class. When modeling your classes think of them as **properties**. In OOP jargon theyâ€™re also known as variables or properties.

When working with classes, we use the following types of variables:
1. Class Variables
2. Instance Variables

## Methods
Method is just a function that is written in a class. The most important method when working with classes is ** __init__() ** , also known as class constructor.
Define all your instance variables inside this method. This will make clear what data your instance needs to function.
