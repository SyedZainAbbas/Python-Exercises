"""
Create a BankAccount class, it should:
  1. Have a maximum_loan class variable. Decide if itâ€™s gonna be public or private.
  2. Store the name of the client and account number upon instantiation.
  
Create a method that grants a loan, it should:  
  1. Add money in the client's account
  2. Record the number of days until the client has to pay back

Create a get_customer_service_address method that: 
  1. Returns an email address.
  2. This email address should be the same for all instances. Decide where and how you will store this email address.
  
Add logic to the class so that:
  1. Requesting a loan above the maximum allowed amount raises a ValueError.
  2. Requesting a loan to be paid in less than 30 days raises an ArithmeticError (it does not fit properly, just for the sake of exercise)
 
Important assumptions:
  1. The maximum amount for a loan should not exceed 1,000,000.
  2. The least amount of days to pay back a loan should be 30.
