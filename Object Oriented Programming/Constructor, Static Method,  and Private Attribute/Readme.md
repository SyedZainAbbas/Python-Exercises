## Constructor

1. The __init__ method can customize how you initialize the data in your object.
2. Self refers to the object being created.
3. The constructor will fill the attributes according to the arguments provided to it.
4. Changing the attribute of one object does not affect the others.
5. You can have a class with no __init__ method.

## Static Method

1. A method related to all objects of the same type.
2. It can not access the member variables of object.
3. It is defined with the decorator **@staticmethod**.
4. Static methods act as normal functions but they are defined inside a class for organizational purposes. They are similar to how modules group functions.

## Private Attribute

There is no such thing as privacy in Python however, it is a convention to start a private attribute with an underscore.
